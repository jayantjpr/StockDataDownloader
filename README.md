StockDataDownloader
===================

This repository contains a javascript and a corresponding minimal HTML front-end which help download Stock Data for many stocks simultaneously in one shot (click).
Only Stocks from Indian Stock Markets NSE & BSE are supported.

The front-end provides an option to select the source of Data (Yahoo Finance or Official NSE/BSE Site).
Also it provided an option to select an interval(start-end dates) and a frequency(daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) for which the data is required.
Any number of stocks can be added in the provided Textarea which can separted by a varity of separators(comman/semi-colon/white_spaces).

It was made for the purpose of automating the tedious task of downloading stockdata which we often face in our Financial Lab assignments.
